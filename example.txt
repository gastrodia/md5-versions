MD5
build status

a JavaScript function for hashing messages with MD5.

Installation

You can use this package on the server side as well as the client side.

Node.js:

npm install md5
API

md5(message)
message -- String or Buffer
returns String
Usage

var md5 = require('md5');

console.log(md5('message'));
This will print the following

78e731027d8fd50ed642340b7c9a63b3
It supports buffers, too

var fs = require('fs');
var md5 = require('md5');

fs.readFile('example.txt', function(err, buf) {
  console.log(md5(buf));
});
Versions

Before version 2.0.0 there were two packages called md5 on npm, one lowercase, one uppercase (the one you're looking at). As of version 2.0.0, all new versions of this module will go to lowercase md5 on npm. To use the correct version, users of this module will have to change their code from require('MD5') to require('md5') if they want to use versions >= 2.0.0.

Bugs and Issues

If you encounter any bugs or issues, feel free to open an issue at github.

Credits

This package is based on the work of Jeff Mott, who did a pure JS implementation of the MD5 algorithm that was published by Ronald L. Rivest in 1991. I needed a npm package of the algorithm, so I used Jeff’s implementation for this package. The original implementation can be found in the CryptoJS project.
